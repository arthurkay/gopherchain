# Gopherchain (GOlang based Blockchain implementation)

This is a proof of concept project to show case the functionality and feasibility of implementing a blockchain from scratch purely written in GO.

The project is largely inspired by Tensor-programming's youtube video, but minor changes and fixes with the changes in badger DB  fro the time the video was done.

This project is in active development, and as such will change regularly and without any notice.

To comminiucate this change the application code base will be committed with version updates using sermver.

And as implied by sermver, a version less than 1 means that the API is unstable and as such, this application should be treated as an unstable and is in no way intended to be used in production as of yet.
